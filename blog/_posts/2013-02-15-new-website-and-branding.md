title: New Website & Branding
---
Hi, I'm Dali Zheng, the new guy at AdStack. My first task has been overhauling the public-facing website of the company, as well as setting the art direction for the products and brand. Rather than coming up with some superficial graphics, I started by focusing on the essence of the company's offerings, blending new techniques in digital marketing with the tried and true email protocol. The body typeface is [Roboto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto), used in millions of Android devices. The header typeface is [Libre Baskerville](http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville), based on Baskerville (designed in the 18th century), which is a modern take on a classic font that juxtaposes old with new. 

The new site has been built from scratch using Jekyll, LESS, CoffeeScript, Grunt, IcoMoon, Bower, and plain old blood, sweat & tears. It is [open-sourced at GitHub](http://github.com/AdStack/adstack.github.com).
