It has been a busy and an exciting time for AdStack. The executive team has been attending events and expanding the team while engineering has made new strides in product design and development. In this month alone AdStack CEO, Evan Reiser, attended the Email Insider Summit on Amelia Island in Florida, two new hires were made and a new version of the AdStack app was launched.   

This is a nother paragra
On Saturday May 4th, Evan spoke on the “real-time inbox” panel at MediaPosts’ Email Insider Summit in Florida. Moderated by Alyssa Nahatis, Director of Deliverability at Neolane, the panel focused on the importance of using technology to make decisions in real-time to improve email engagement. Other panelists include Jordan Cohen, VP of Marketing at Movable Ink, Paige Henke, Manager of Digital CRM at Verizon Wireless and Geri Weltz, Director of Email Marketing at Beyond.com. The majority of the discussion focused on current technology opportunities, like AdStack, which allows email content to change based on end users interaction. Although marketers know this technology exists and has a proven ROI, adoption rates have been slow.

This week, AdStack launched a new version of the app. The dashboard got a make over, making it easier for customers to search for campaigns and interpret their campaign data. Customers will still upload campaigns in the same fashion but the over all look and the design of the app is more user-friendly.
