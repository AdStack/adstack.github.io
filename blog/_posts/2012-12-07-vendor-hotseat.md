Operative’s Op-Ed took their Vendor Hot Seat series on the road to ad:tech NYC, asking ad tech vendors to answer our [five questions not in writing, but on camera](http://bcove.me/cdwbss7i).

AdStack’s co-founder and director of business development, Dan Quintero, answered these five questions below.

1. How do you help publishers make money?
2. What’s your pricing model?
3. How are you different from your competitors?
4. What are the titles of people who use your product, and how do they use it?
5. What would Randall Rothenberg say about your company?
