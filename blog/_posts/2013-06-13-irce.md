Last week AdStack exhibited at IRCE, the [Internet Retailer Conference & Exhibition](https://www.irce.com/), in Chicago, Illinois. The conference is the biggest e-commerce conference in the world and from Tuesday-Friday over 9,000 people attended.

IRCE was a great conference to be a part of with more than 600 companies exhibiting. Each day multiple people stopped by the AdStack booth asking about our technology and wanting to incorporate LiveOptimizer into their current email program. People we spoke with were extremely impressed that we have developed a technology that lets users change the content of an email after it has already been sent. 

In addition to the exhibition hall, great networking parties were thrown each night giving the exhibitors and attendees yet another opportunity to network and meet potential clients. On Wednesday night AdStack attended the networking event at the House of Blues where exhibitors and attendees gathered for dinner, drinks and a live performance by the Blue Brotherâ€™s. 

The conference has already proven to be an excellent investment. So, until next time Chicago.
