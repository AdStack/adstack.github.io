Often clients come to us wanting a quick and easy fix to expand their list size so that they can grow their user base and increase their revenue. They have an idea that buying a list will cheaply get them the users they want. The reality is that lists that are cheap are cheap for a reason, and you can actually incur more of a risk by using your own email service provider to blast out a marketing message to a bunch of unknown email addresses. While some lists may be beneficial, often times they can lead to disaster. 

Here are the risks you incur when purchasing a cheap email list:
*	Targeting people that are not interested in your product/service 
*	Reaching email addresses that are inactive
*	Having your email go directly to the spam folder since you are sending an email to people who have not subscribed to your list
*	Getting your email service provider disabled because your sending out emails to non-trusted recipients
*	Wasting money, time and marketing efforts
