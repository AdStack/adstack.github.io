Today is a big day for AdStack; we are officially partners with ExactTarget. This is great news for AdStack because marketers will have more access to LiveOptimizer, a tool to ensure that customers are viewing the most relevant content in an email at the right time. 

Through A/B/n and multivariate tests that analyze recipient engagement with email, LiveOptimizer will help marketers to achieve the best possible campaign performance resulting in a higher return on investment. With ExactTarget, marketers will get access to the LiveOptimizer app directly through HubExchange making integration simple and easy. 

Even ExactTargets vice president of platform, and developer community, Ian Murdock, was excited over the news, “Together with companies like AdStack, ExactTarget is transforming digital marketing, providing marketers around the world with a powerful platform and ecosystem of integrated applications to create customer experience that build loyalty and drive results.”
