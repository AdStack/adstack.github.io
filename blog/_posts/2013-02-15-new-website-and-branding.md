title: New Website & Branding
---
Hi, I'm Dali Zheng, the new front-end engineer / designer at AdStack. My first task has been rebranding the company, starting with the website. Rather than coming up with some superficial graphics, I started by focusing on the essence of the companyâ€™s offerings, blending new techniques in digital marketing with the tried and true email protocol. From this perspective emerged an aesthetic grounded in old school, direct response print advertising & 18th century typography, brought into the future with modern typefaces and responsive design.
